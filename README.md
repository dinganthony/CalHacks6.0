Our team's project for CalHacks 6.0, SportsCar, uses the Ford AppLink API for vehicle control and user interfaces. The Ford API is based on the SmartDeviceLink API (http://smartdevicelink.com). Given user voice commands and audio input, SportsCar uses Natural Language Processing to parse the input to detect a selected sports team. If the team is currently playing a game, SportsCar webscrapes (Selenium + BeautifulSoup) various streaming websites to find livestreams and plays audio output into the car.
